    "Let's think about quantization from a very high level - and use some oversimplifications to understand what's really happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of quantization as placing a pin on the number line (our quantization constant) and then expressing a low-precision zero-centered size-64 block range around that pinned number. Exploiting the fact that our weights are normally distributed and that we scale them to be in the range [-1, 1], this lets use use our NF4 datatype to roughly optimally express our high precision weights in a low precision format. While we still do need some higher precision numbers - this process lets use represent many numbers in low precision for the cost of 1 number in high precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can take it one step further - and we can actually quantize the range of quantization constants we wind up with as well! This winds up saving us ~0.373 bits per parameter."
